## Hi everyone,
My name is **Gurdeep**. I'm a **tech enthusiast**.
I did my Computer Engineering from National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra,India
I also love Hacking and frequently take part in CTF competition. My CTF team is Scr!ptk!dd!es and we also have a dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nbZJekr) you can join if you want to play CTF with us.

Other than Hacking and programming , I also love to 

* play Chess
* read books
* watch movies
* play Basketball
* Freestyle hip-hop dance
* Rap

Here I will share  mostly my tech-related thoughts, but also I will share anything I feel like sharing.
