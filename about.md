## Hi everyone,
My name is **Gurdeep**. I'm a Software Developer currently working at [Mfilterit](https://www.mfilterit.com)
I did my Computer Engineering from National Institute of Kurukshetra,India
I also love Hacking and frequently take part in CTF competition. My CTF team is Scr!ptk!dd!es and we also have a dedicated [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/nbZJekr) you can join if you want to play CTF with us.

Other than Hacking and programming , I also love to play Chess, reading books, watching movies and play Basketball.

Here I will share  mostly my tech-related thoughts, but also I will share anything I feel like sharing.
